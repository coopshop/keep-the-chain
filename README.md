# Keep the chain

"Keep the chain" is a tool to keep consistency with your goals, and in your life. It is a simple prototype of a complete new way to keep track of your life, and to reach new plateaus. The premis is simple; keep the chain as long as possible.

You might want to do a good deed every day, exercise every day, make sure you write something every day, or something completely different. It just have to be something you need to do for a longer period. Note: If you are tracking, e.g. exercise, you might want to keep a day, or two, off every week. If this is your workout regime, then you should just mark these days done, as it is still part of the chain.

## Get started

To get started, you simply put all the files in one directory, and access index.html. Download the zip and unpack, or just fork it.

Start by setting a goal to track, such as e.g. exercise every day, or write down a new idea every day. Then start track it every day.

Tip: The system works best if you see the timeline as much as possible to keep remind you about the work day. It can be in a second monitor, or wherever you like.
